# Janggi (Korean Chess)
This program is an implementation of Janggi (Korean chess) for a school project. 

Per the class project instructions, I initially built the program in Python with a simple console user interface. However, I then desired to play the game in the browser as well as publish it to the web, so I rewrote the program in Javascript and built an HTML/CSS interface. The site leverages browser localStorage to save the game status for subsequent page reloads. 

Note per the school project rubric, certain rules are excluded from this implementation. For example, generals are permitted to face each other from across the board.
